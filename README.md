# SpeechRecognition
WesBos - Javascript30 - Speech Recognition app with some custom modifications.

Speech commands: 

'Go to Google' => Google.com,
'Go to Youtube' => Youtube.com,
'Go to Instagram' => Instagram.com,
'Go to Facebook' => Facebook.com,
'Go to GitHub' => Github.com,

More will be added soon. I'm hoping to add some API commands, such as a weather API or crime around your area. I'm also hoping to redesign the whole thing and make it look like some secret agent shit. For now play around with it or something. Idk.
